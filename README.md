# CPW219-ModelBinding Styling Lab - By Alex Fischer
<p>Using Bootstrap 5 (And a little help from Copilot), I was able to revamp the UI's CSS to look more lively while also keeping it's responsivness.</p>
<p>I had quite a bit of fun learning more about Bootstrap, and look forward to using it again. :D</p>

## Home Page
<p>The header is probably one of the most important parts of a webpage. The header, paragraph, and buttons are set inside a container (probably not very noticable). The buttons are using Bootstrap Icons.</p>

## Printer List
<p>Here, I tried to make my Printer List look a little bit like a variation of Amazon.com. This uses a basic HTML table, and the price tag includes Bootstrap's success background to look like a price tag. Behind the scenes, this will work if you add more printers in the database. Also, if there is no image provided, the text "No image" will be used as a placeholder.</p>

## User Profile Page
<p>This page includes a card that contains a rounded profile image. The email is clickable. If you click it, you will be asked what email provider you'd like to use, and auto-fill the subject for you.</p>
